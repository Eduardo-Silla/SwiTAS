And it goes, and it goes
And it goes a little something like this

Hit it!
Aaron's in the chat
Come on
Get up get up
I want to type it out
Here we go
Aaron's in the chat
Get up get up
Aaron's in the chat

Yo guys, check it out
Guess what happened to me
(Another crazy story, join the VC)
I was hanging at the chat
Just debugging an app
Working on my code
(Yeah, we heard it all)
I heard the fans screaming
I thought it was for me

But then I heard a ping
It was in front of me
It was, indeed, Shakkar23
(What? What did he say?)
(How 'bout some one-on-one, do you want to play?)
I told him why not, I got some time
But when I beat you real bad
Try not to cry

Yeah, portal master from Cali
(You must've been nervous)
I knew I could take him
Stared' at Shak, psyche him out
I said Sherlokkar, you're in my house now
Start the game the whistle blows
Pay attention close 'cause the story goes

It's like boom (boom)
I shot it from the gun
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shak

It's like boom (boom)
I shot it from the gun
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shak

So check it out
I thought I had the lead
But then he started throwing mad boxes at me
I was makin' them shots
Was he solving the room?
I knew that there was a way that I could make it stop

I had a plan, that I could change the pace
I said, Yo Shak you missed that button
He looked away, I got to the elevator
I'm taking him to school now, watch me all
A 3 second lead, nothing but wins
Come on Shak, had enough yet?
Faster by two, I'm way ahead
I guess your getting nervous
'Cause you already lost

It's like boom (boom)
I shot it from the gun
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shak

Shot after shot
Jam after jam
Pika is cheering
Aaron's the man

Shot after shot
Jam after jam
Pika is cheering
Aaron's the man

Soren was shocked
Couldn't believe it was real
(I can't believe a kid just stuffed Sherlokkar)
One more second, was all that remained
I passed him right by
I put him in shame
I must admit that it sounds real crazy
but the shot hit right
Then he cried like a baby
Sorry Shak, I should've let you win
You're good too
And we can still be friends

Soren went nuts
They put me on their shoulders
Then I heard a voice
And it sounded like my mother

Ma, can't you see that I'm playing the game?
(How you could be playing if you're still in bed?)
(Are you gettin' sick, did you hit your head?)
Aw, man it was all a dream
I guess that kinda thing could never happen to me

If it was a dream and it wasn't real

How'd I get a jersey with the name Shak?
Woah

It's like boom (boom)
I shot it from the gun
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts

'Cause that's how I beat Shak
It's like boom (boom)
I shot it from the gun
Like slam (slam)
I heard the crowd screaming out jam (jam)
I swear that I'm telling you the facts
'Cause that's how I beat Shak
